# simplesound

a simple music / audio player made in Godot. It is meant to mirror how spotify looks like, and works, and all ran with local files.
it has it's own simple object format that looks like JSON but with class / object definitions.

Feel free to report issues and bugs! It would help out a lot.

Goals:
* Add cloud syncing
* Fix up all bugs and random code inconsistencies
* Implement Searching
* Add playlist and song re-ordering.

> Note: Yes I am aware of the first version being broken, I will try my best to fix it ASAP
